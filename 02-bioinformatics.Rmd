[Irizarry & Love](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences) is a great pay-as-you-like textbook by two very well-known figures in the field (Rafael Irizarry is a statistican from the Havard School of Health with a long research and publication in statistical Bioinformatics; Michael Love co-developed the differential gene expression analysis R package DESeq2).

I found [Ewens & Grant](https://www.bookdepository.com/Statistical-Methods-in-Bioinformatics/9780387400822) an excellent resource when I started learning about (statistical) Bioinformatics, combining a refresher in statistics with introductions to many computational/statistical Bioinformatics subjects.

[Gentleman et al.](https://www.bookdepository.com/Bioinformatics-Computational-Biology-Solutions-Using-R-Bioconductor-Robert-Gentleman/9780387251462) give many Bioinformatics examples using publicly available data and methods available in R/Bioconductor. Authors include very prominent figures in the field.

[Krijnen, *Applied Statistics for Bioinformatics using R*](ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/doc/contrib/Krijnen-IntroBioInfStatistics.pdf)

From the preface of Krijnen:

> "The purpose of this book is to give an introduction into statistics in order to solve some problems of bioinformatics. Statistics provides procedures to explore and visualize data as well as to test biological hypotheses. The book intends to be introductory in explaining and programming elementary statistical concepts, thereby bridging the gap between high school levels and the specialized statistical literature."
