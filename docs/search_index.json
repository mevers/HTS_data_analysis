Disclaimer: The list of resources is highly selective, and provides by no means a comprehensive database of all available resources. Instead I list books and resources that I personally have found (and continue to find) useful during my research. "],
["general-statistics-and-statistical-modelling.html", "1 General statistics and statistical modelling 1.1 Books 1.2 Tutorial and notes 1.3 Free ebooks 1.4 Web sources, blogs and online forums", " 1 General statistics and statistical modelling 1.1 Books Following are some great books that focus on a more practical introduction to statistics and statistical modelling (e.g. using R as a compute environment). The order of books loosely reflects the increase in complexity of the material covered. Many introductory statistics textbooks exist. I am listing here Stats - Data and models by de Veaux as one of the more modern introductory statistics book. It has received (and continues to receive) very positive reviews, covers the basics and more, and is targeting undergraduate students across different disciplines (biomedical sciences, social sciences, political sciences, physics, etc.). Unfortunately it is not cheap. Dalgaard and Casella &amp; Berger are two introductory and more advanced statistics textbooks. McElreath offers a fantastic introduction to Bayesian statistics and modelling, with a minimum dependence on existing stats and maths knowledge. Gelman et al. is a very comprehensive treatise on Bayesian data analysis containing many practical examples. 1.2 Tutorial and notes Bååth, Beginners Exercise: Bayesian computation with Stan and Farmer Jöns Bååth, Answers to Bayesian Computation with Stan and Farmer Jöns Bååth gives a set of tutorial questions involving Bayesian statistics using R and Stan. Betancourt, A Conceptual Introduction to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo: Betancourt gives a comprehensive account of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) while avoiding (most of) the mathematical details. HMC has become a key element in statistical computing, and is used in software implementations such as Stan. 1.3 Free ebooks I have not used the OpenIntro Statistics book but reviews have been very favourable. It’s also free. OpenIntro also offers additional reading and course material. 1.4 Web sources, blogs and online forums CrossValidated CrossValidated is an online forum for people interested in statistics, machine learning, and data analysis. CrossValidated focusses on the theory and methodology of analysing data rather than on programming language-specific issues.

["general-bioinformatics.html", "2 General bioinformatics 2.1 Books 2.2 Free Ebooks, notes, and manuscripts 2.3 Web sources, blogs and online forums", " 2 General bioinformatics 2.1 Books Following are some general introductory Bioinformatics textbooks. Irizarry &amp; Love is a great pay-as-you-like textbook by two very well-known figures in the field (Rafael Irizarry is a statistican from the Havard School of Health with a long research and publication history in statistical Bioinformatics; Michael Love co-developed the differential gene expression analysis R package DESeq2). I found Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics by Ewens &amp; Grant an excellent resource when I started learning about (statistical) Bioinformatics, combining a refresher in statistics with introductions to many computational/statistical Bioinformatics subjects. Gentleman et al. give many Bioinformatics examples using publicly available data and methods available in R/Bioconductor. Authors include very prominent figures in the field. 2.2 Free Ebooks, notes, and manuscripts Krijnen, Applied Statistics for Bioinformatics using R From the preface of Krijnen: “The purpose of this book is to give an introduction into statistics in order to solve some problems of bioinformatics. Statistics provides procedures to explore and visualize data as well as to test biological hypotheses. The book intends to be introductory in explaining and programming elementary statistical concepts, thereby bridging the gap between high school levels and the specialized statistical literature.” 2.3 Web sources, blogs and online forums Biostars Biostars is one of the active online forums where various Bioinformatics-related questions are regularly discussed. SEQanswers SEQanswers is the other online forum, again with a very active community. In comparison to Biostars, SEQanswer focusses on issues surrounding HTS data and its analysis. "],
["r-programming.html", "3 R programming 3.1 Tutorial and notes 3.2 Ebooks 3.3 Online courses 3.4 Web sources, blogs and online forums", " 3 R programming Disclaimer: The following sections list introductory and more advanced material on programming in R, without any claim of completeness. The order of the materials in every section roughly reflects increasing complexity/difficulty/comprehensiveness. I am listing tutorial materials and notes first and (e)books second, because in my opinion learning R requires a practical learning-by-doing and following-examples type of approach. The best thing to do is to “start coding” yourself right from the start. It goes without saying that in order to be able to execute R code, you need to install the R compute environment on your computer. You can download R from the R Project. RStudio is a full IDE (integrated development environment) for code development, including an editor and tools for code management, debugging, and plotting. I highly recommend using it. 3.1 Tutorial and notes Gautier, R crash course: A short (17 pages) crash course on programming in R. I recommend this as a half-day crash-course introduction to R. I have used this material in the past when running R-based gene expression analysis courses for biologists. Venables et al., An Introduction to R: Fairly comprehensive notes (105 pages) on R from CRAN. This is a step up from the crash-course overview. Working through this should give you a good practical working knowledge of how to “do things” in R. Either read front-to-back or use alongside implementing some simple R projects. Phillips, Yarrr! The pirate’s guide to R: From the book “This book is meant to introduce you to the basic analytical tools in R, from basic coding and analyses, to data wrangling, plotting, and statistical inference.” Phillips more or less covers similar ground to Venables, and also introduces some popular and useful R packages from the tidyverse. Wickham, Advanced R: From the website “The book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language.” From the master himself. Bryan et al., Happy Git and GitHub for the useR: This is a tutorial on how to setup Git/GitHub within RStudio. It covers basic Git/GitHub and how to connect RStudio to Git/GitHub. 3.2 Ebooks Some of the following books cover very advanced topics. I would not recommend an R beginner starting with these; however, topics covered in these books will become relevant as computational R projects become more complex. Gillespie &amp; Lovelace have an online version of their O’Reilly book Efficient R programming. From the website: “There are many excellent R resources for visualization, data science, and package development. Hundreds of scattered vignettes, web pages, and forums explain how to use R in particular domains. But little has been written on how to simply make R work effectively—until now. This hands-on book teaches novices and experienced R users how to write efficient R code.” ModernDive - An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim is an online open-source textbook, aiming at teaching students how to use R to explore and visualise data, use randomisation and simulation to build inferential ideas, effectively create stories using these ideas to convey information to a lay audience.`` [Taken from the introduction] Zumel &amp; Mount has received a lot of positive reviews. From the website: “Practical Data Science with R lives up to its name. It explains basic principles without the theoretical mumbo-jumbo and jumps right to the real use cases you’ll face as you collect, curate, and analyze the data crucial to the success of your business. You’ll apply the R programming language and statistical analysis techniques to carefully explained examples based in marketing, business intelligence, and decision support.” I haven’t had a chance to check out this book yet; based on reviews and on the website, Zumel &amp; Mount provide an introduction to practical R through typical data science problems involving statistical modelling, machine learning, data visualisation, etc. Wickham &amp; Grolemund have an online version of their upcoming (late 2016) O’Reilly book R for Data Science. James et al., An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R: From the website: “This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist.” This book can be considered the little brother of The Elements of Statistical Learning. Rodrigues, Functional programming and unit testing for data munging in R: This is a pay-as-you-like ebook that discusses unit testing (using the R package testthat) and package development in R. It’s currently (as of January 2017) 60% complete. 3.3 Online courses Various online courses exist. Following are two sites that provide links to practical online R courses. Some are free, some are not. R course finder: Provides a list of nearly 100 R courses, offered by various universities and institutes, in different formats, and at different costs (starting from free). R courses on coursera: Introductory R courses exist from Johns Hopkins and Duke universities. 3.4 Web sources, blogs and online forums R has a very active community, and in my experience staying up to date with new developments requires at least occasionally following various web sources. https://cran.r-project.org/ The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) is the central platform for R package distribution. Here you can search for available R packages, and access the often extensive R package documentation (in the form of vignettes and reference manuals). All packages from CRAN can be installed directly from within R. install.packages(&quot;package_name&quot;); https://www.bioconductor.org/ Bioconductor provides tools for the statistical analysis and visualisation of HTS data. This includes specialised R packages (including extensive vignettes and reference manuals) and tutorials. All R/Bioconductor packages can be installed directly from within R. source(&quot;https://www.bioconductor.org/biocLite.R&quot;); biocLite(&quot;package_name&quot;); R-bloggers R-bloggers is an aggregate blog site, with news surrounding R package development, R tutorials and general R updates. Articles cover a very broad spectrum of R applications. R Weekly Weekly updates from the R community. http://stackoverflow.com/ Help for R-related programming questions can be found on Stack Overflow. Before posting a new question, make sure to search through their records of R-related questions. Chances are generally very high that somebody has had a similar issue at some point in the past. "],
["rna-seq-data-analysis.html", "4 RNA-seq data analysis 4.1 General workflow 4.2 Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis 4.3 Fusion gene identification 4.4 Read simulation", " 4 RNA-seq data analysis Many resources and introductory tutorials to typical RNA-seq workflows exist on the web. The choice of tools and computational methods is often a matter of choice. Generally R/Bioconductor is a great resource for HTS-data related tutorials. Often the best approach is to locally reproduce results discussed as part of different tools. For example, most R/Bioconductor packages provide sample analyses and case studies as part of their vignettes. 4.1 General workflow A typical RNA-seq data analysis workflow may consist of (some or all of) the following steps (in brackets are tools that I have used in the past): Quality assessment of raw reads (fastqc) Adapter trimming and quality filtering (cutadapt, trimmomatic, bbduk.sh) Read alignment to reference genome (bowtie2, tophat, bwa-mem, STAR) Quality assessment of mapped reads (RseQC, QoRTs), QualiMap Read de-duplication (samtools, picard-tools) Count summarisation (HTSeq, featureCounts) Differential gene expression analysis (DESeq2, limma, edgeR) Gene ontology enrichment analysis/Gene set enrichment analysis (clusterProfiler, GSEA) Conesa et al. have published a survey of best practices for RNA-seq data analysis that provides a nice overview of typical analysis steps and how to critically assess results. Williams et al. have published a quantitative assessment of different RNA-seq analysis workflows using a large variety of read aligners and differential gene expression analysis tools. Griffith lab RNA-seq tutorial Griffith et al. provide an online Wiki-style RNA-seq analysis tutorial with exercises. Daniel Cook - Awesome Bioinformatics Daniel Cook maintains a list of Bioinformatics tools and programs on github. 4.2 Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis I can specifically recommend the following three tutorials/vignettes surrounding the R packages DESeq2 and limma. In terms of the underlying statistical model, there exists a lot of overlap between DESeq2 and limma. Whether to use one over the other is therefore largely a matter of choice. Both methods are often regarded as the gold-standard methods in regards to DGE analyses. http://www.bioconductor.org/help/workflows/rnaseqGene/ R/Bioconductor has a good tutorial on how to get from raw RNA-seq data to identifying differentially expressed genes. DESeq2 The vignette is regularly updated and offers a great tutorial on how to perform differential gene expression analyses within R. The vignette also provides details on the underlying statistical modelling approach. Personally, I slightly favour the DESeq2 documentation and approach in my own research analyses. Limma The user guide offers an excellent tutorial using a wide range of different sample case studies on performing differential gene expression analyses within R. 4.3 Fusion gene identification Various fusion/chimeric transcript identification tools exist. Liu et al. performed a similar benchmark analysis of 15 fusion detection tools in their 2015 Nucleic Acids Research paper. Another list of 39 (as of December 2016) fusion detection tools in given on Biostars. InFusion InFusion is one of the most recently published tools. It was written in C++/Python, and provides detailed instructions on how to compile the source code, and run the program. 4.4 Read simulation Simulating reads for typical high-throughput sequencing experiments is often useful for assessing and benchmarking novel computational methods. Tools specialise in the simulation of reads from different library protocols (e.g. RNA-seq, whole-genome and exome sequencing) and different sequencing technologies (e.g. Illumina, SOLiD, 454, PacBio). Escalona et al., provide a recent (2016) comparison of tools for the simulation of HTS data. This review is a good starting point to explore different methods, by following the references provided. Flux Simulator is a read simulator for RNA-seq experiments. I have used Flux Simulator in the past to e.g. simulate small RNA and miRNA reads, for assessing the performance of a computational miRNA identification method. "],
["chip-seq-data-analysis.html", "5 ChIP-seq data analysis 5.1 General workflow 5.2 The Cistrome project 5.3 Controls and replicate libraries 5.4 Library quality assessment 5.5 References", " 5 ChIP-seq data analysis Work in progress (August 2017)… 5.1 General workflow A typical workflow for the analysis of transcription factor (TF) ChIP-seq data may consist of the following steps. Tools are given in brackets. Quality assessment of raw reads (fastqc) Adapter trimming and quality filtering (cutadapt, trimmomatic, bbduk.sh) Read alignment to reference genome (bowtie2) Quality assessment of mapped reads (QualiMap) Read de-duplication (samtools, picard-tools) ChIP library assessment (deepTools) Meta-gene analysis (deepTools) Peak calling (MACS2) 5.2 The Cistrome project The cistrome refers to “the set of cis-acting targets of a trans-acting factor on a genome-wide scale, also known as the in vivo genome-wide location of transcription factor binding-sites or histone modifications”. The cistrome project includes a variety of ChIP-seq data analysis tools developed by the lab of Shirley Liu. For example, the Cistrome Data Browser is a good resource for identifying publicly available ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data. 5.3 Controls and replicate libraries It is critical to have controls for the ChIP libraries to estimate non-specific binding across the genome. The two most frequently used methods use (1) DNA input samples, or (2) IgG “mock-ChIP” control samples. Various publications discuss potential benefits of one method over the other, and it appears that the choice of controls is to some extent based on individual experience and personal preference. Overall, the use of input DNA as controls seems to be preferred over IgG controls (see e.g. Kiddler et al., Landt et al., Meyer and Liu). It is important to keep in mind that control libraries are subject to systematic biases due to genomic copy number variations, sequencing biases, read mapping ambiguities, and cell-type specific chromatin structure [Vega et al.]. The original 2012 ENCODE guidelines [Land et al.] state that “more than two replicates did not significantly improve site discovery”, and therefore define a standard for ChIP measurements to “be performed on two independent biological repliates”. Results from more recent publications strongly encourage \\(n\\geq 3\\) replicate libraries to increase the reliability in the identification of binding sites. For example, [Yang et al.] demonstrate that a simple majority-rule-approach “identifies peaks more reliably in all biological replicates than the absolute concordance of peak identification between any two replicates, further demonstrating the utility of increasing replicate numbers in ChIP-seq experiments”. 5.4 Library quality assessment 5.4.1 Alignment stats Following read alignment, bowtie2’s alignment summaries give a first insight into library quality and sequencing depth. Using an unmasked reference genome, mappability of input samples is commonly around 70-90%. In a repeat-masked reference genome, around 50% of the genomic sequence is identified as interspersed repeats and low-complexity DNA and masked with N’s (see e.g. RepeatMasker); consequently, alignment of input reads against a repeat-masked reference genome will give lower mappability rates around 35-55%. For example, we use a repeat-masked mouse reference genome with an additional copy of the canonical rDNA repeat unit to explore protein binding to the rDNA, and obtain mappability rates of around 40% for high-quality input samples. 5.4.2 Read duplication Generally, quality control of aligned reads should include an assessment of the duplication percentage of read (pairs). It is generally advisable to remove duplicate read pairs prior to proceeding with any down-stream analysis; however, some peak-callers (like MACS2) will indepedently remove read duplicates as part of their analysis workflow. We can identify and mark duplicate reads using picard-tools MarkDuplicates and/or remove duplicates directly using picard-tools MarkDuplicates REMOVE_DUPLICATES=TRUE. Alternatively, we can use samtools rmdup to remove duplicates. The total percentage of duplicate reads and their chromosomal distribution provide insight into library complexity and biases. 5.4.3 Fingerprint plot A powerful tool to assess the quality of libraries from a ChIP-seq experiment is to plot the fingerprint of a library. The term “fingerprint (plot)” has been coined by the deepTools dev’s, but the original idea was introduced by Diaz et al. From deepTools: This quality control will most likely be of interest for you if you are dealing with ChIP-seq samples as a pressing question in ChIP-seq experiments is “Did my ChIP work?”, i.e. did the antibody-treatment enrich sufficiently so that the ChIP signal can be separated from the background signal? (After all, around 90% of all DNA fragments in a ChIP experiment will represent the genomic background). The fingerprint of a ChIP/input library characterises how much of the genome (that is covered by reads) is covered by how large a fraction of the total number of reads. The following figure is taken from deepTools’ documentation. A simple example on how the fingerprint distribution is calculated from a read distribution is shown in the following diagram. 5.4.4 Further QC Further quality control checks typically involve a principle component analysis of read coverage (1) across the full (binned) genome, and (2) within identified common peak regions. Following appropriate centering of read counts, samples should separate along the first principle component according to whether they are input or ChIP libraries. Separation on the second principle component should then occur according to e.g. biological replicates, time-points or ChIP antibody (depending on the experiment design). Additionally, a correlation analysis based on either counts directly or on their ranks gives a summary statistic characterising within-replicate reproducibility. It is important to keep in mind that Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient will dependent on the dynamic range of the two input variables; we therefore expect on average larger correlation coefficients in pairwise comparisons of input libraries than of ChIP libraries. 5.5 References Bailey et al., Practical Guidelines for the Comprehensive Analysis of ChIP-seq Data, PLoS Comp.
