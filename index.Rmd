# Preface {-}

The following sections provide links to introductory reading material and resources to general statistics, bioinformatics, R programming, and various high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data analysis steps.

Disclaimer: The list of resources is highly selective, and provides by no means a comprehensive database of all available resources. Instead I list books and resources that I personally have found (and continue to find) useful during my research.
